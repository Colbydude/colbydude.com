Rise Above The Mark is a 2014 documentary on the public education system and how politics affects it. I was hired by Jack Klink and the West Lafayette Schools Education Foundation to build the website. The website serves as a simple marketing website, as well as a means purchasing a license to host a showing of the documentary. Administrators of the site can also manage and track showings. The site is built on [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to process payments. Site design by [Jack Klink](https://jacklink.productions).
