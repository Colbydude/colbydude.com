_We didn't know what to call it..._

I participated in the [Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019) in 2019 with [@tlo](https://bsky.app/profile/tlo.icecavern.games) as a means to dive headfirst into [Unity](https://unity.com/). The theme was "Only One". We had the idea to do a simple "puzzle platformer" where the character had _only one_ item they can leverage, but it had several different functions. In this case, a ladder. You could use the ladder... as a ladder, a bridge, as a weapon, and throw it to trigger switches. Our results weren't stellar, but it was nice being able to complete something in time.
