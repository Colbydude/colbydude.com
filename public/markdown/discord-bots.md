I've put together a handful of [Discord](https://discord.com/) bots in JavaScript to add additional functionality and fun to some servers I manage. One bot I've made for a friend is a simple bot that'll allow you to input a search query and it'll respond with an image from Tumblr, based on that query. Another is a bot that will manage roles based on games people want to play in my personal server. Users can tell the bot to add a game, then it'll create a role where users can opt in to get notifications for that game. I also have a couple more bots I've put together for private use.
