YouTube Karaoke is a quick [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) app I put together for my birthday party in 2019. I wanted a quick way for people to be able to put in songs for them to sing via karaoke by just dropping in YouTube links. This uses the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) to parse information from the given links, then uses [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) to broadcast queue information to all connected devices.
