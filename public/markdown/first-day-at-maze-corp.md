First Day at Maze Corp. is a first-person puzzle/exploration game built in a week with [@tlo](https://bsky.app/profile/tlo.icecavern.games) for [Brackeys Game Jam 2025.1](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-13) and ranked 59th overall out of 2199 entries (top 3%!). Players must navigate the maze-like office building using paint to leave notes on the walls. Complete all your tasks so you donâ€™t get fired! I built out the core mechanics and systems for the game.
