FosterPlatformer is a C# port of [@NoelFB](https://twitter.com/NoelFB)'s [tink_link](https://github.com/NoelFB/tiny_link) game. I thought it would be a fun project to get myself back into the swing of game dev in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. It's built using the [Foster](https://github.com/NoelFB/Foster) framework and is fully open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Colbydude/FosterPlatformer). Original programming and assets all belong to [@NoelFB](https://twitter.com/NoelFB).
