Project Praelium is a WIP, turn-based, RPG built in [Unity](https://unity.com/). Inspired by classic JRPGs such as Shin Megami Tensei and Trails, [@tlozsr_iidx](https://twitter.com/tlozsr_iidx) and I put together a short (~60 minutes) prototype focusing heavily on fleshing out the core mechanics of our strategic turn-based battle system. I am responsible for architecting and implementing most of the game-wide systems, such as battle flow, enemy AI, UI, input, and data management. I've also been working deeply with Unity's [UI Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIElements.html) to take advantage of my knowledge of web technologies in order to build a robust UI.
