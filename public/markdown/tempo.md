TEMPO is an HTML5 shoot'em up arcade game for mobile devices developed with [@Programancer](https://twitter.com/Programancer) and built with [GameMaker Studio](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/gamemaker). I handled optimizing the game for HTML5 and integrated support for ads and analytics. I also ported the entirety of the game from GMS1 to GMS2 later down the line. The game was licensed to (now defunct) BoosterMedia and distributed to various HTML5 game websites.
