I was hired by [Holler](https://holler.io), formerly Emogi, to create the MVP for the Emogi [Twitch.tv extension](https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/extensions/). The frontend is a simple [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) app that calls their provided API to search and fetch stickers. When a sticker is chosen, the sticker information will be broadcast through Twitch's pubsub service to display the sticker on stream to everyone viewing. This extension has been discontinued.
