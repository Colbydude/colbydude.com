Pipe Drain is a simple HTML5 puzzle game designed for mobile devices I built using [GameMaker Studio](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/gamemaker). It was licensed and distributed to a handful HTML5 game websites through (now defunct) BoosterMedia. The game is now open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Colbydude/PipeDrainGMS2/). Artwork by [@Programancer](https://bsky.app/profile/programancer.com).
