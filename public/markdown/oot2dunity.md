OoT2D Unity is a (very much incomplete) Zelda fan game developed using [Unity](https://unity.com/). I started working on this immediately after the 2019 GMTK Game Jam to continue to familiarize myself with the Unity engine. In its current state, Link just has a handful of basic actions such as rolling, attacking with a sword, and picking up objects. It also has a means of automatically importing sprites and animations from [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) files and maps from [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) files. The project is fully open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Colbydude/OoT2DUnity). Inspired by [Team Dekunutz's OoT2D FSA project](http://zfgc.com/forum/index.php?topic=30924).
