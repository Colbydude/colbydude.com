FlyBug is an HTML5/mobile arcade game designed for iOS devices built using [GameMaker Studio](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/gamemaker) alongside [@Programancer](https://bsky.app/profile/programancer.com) at the peak of "Flappy Bird"'s popularity. I was responsible for integrating score-sharing via social media, integrating [Apple Game Center](https://developer.apple.com/game-center/) support to allow for an online leaderboard, as well as HTML5 ads and analytics. The game launched on iOS in June 2014 and was sunset in 2015. Artwork and music by [@Programancer](https://bsky.app/profile/programancer.com).
