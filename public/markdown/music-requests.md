Music Requests is the first [Twitch.tv extension](https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/extensions/) I built, in which I was among the first of 100 developers to ship an extension. I built this solo endeavor using the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) PHP framework for the backend and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) for the frontend. It has been installed by over 60,000 broadcasters and supports popular VGM musicians such as [ToxicxEternity](https://twitch.tv/toxicxeternity) and [TeraCMusic](https://twitch.tv/teracmusic) in their streams. The frontend for this extension is open source and available on GitHub. Sunset in 2025.
