I was hired by Eric Van Cleave to build out his website where he could sell his and his comapany's show choir arrangements with ease. The app includes a full cart with checkout flow (though payment is _not_ handled on the site), and content management for Eric. This is another [Laravel](https://laravel.com) app, but uses [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) for the frontend for an incredibly lightweight JavaScript bundle.
