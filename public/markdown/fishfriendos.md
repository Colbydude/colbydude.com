FishFriendos is a cooperative HTML5 game, inside of a [Twitch.tv extension](https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/extensions/). Twitch reached out to me to put together an extension to showcase a new feature on their extension platform. I was responsible for putting together a small development team to bring this product to completion in 2 months. I was the lead developer, focusing on building the Serverless backend leveraging Amazon Web Services and the core components of the game using [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/). The extension was released in April 2018 and is featured on Twitch's [Bits Extensions to Try](https://dev.twitch.tv/extensions/bits-extensions-to-try/) page. Additional gameplay programming by [@tlo](https://bsky.app/profile/tlo.icecavern.games). Artwork by [@Piranhartist](https://bsky.app/profile/piranhartist.bsky.social).
