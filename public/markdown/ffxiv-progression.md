XIVProgression is a pet project I have been actively maintaining since 2013 to track a character's main scenario, trial, and raid progression in the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV. It's a simple [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) app that leverages the [XIVAPI](https://xivapi.com/) to fetch information from The Lodestone. I wanted a feature on The Lodestone that was similar World of Warcraft's raid progression tracker and decided to build it out myself. The app has been used by over 2,000 players.
